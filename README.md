<h1>Central-Workflow</h1>
This is an example of Central Workflow model. The repository contains only one master branch. All changes are committed to it. The repository can be local with no remote copies, or it can be stored remotely where it can be cloned or pushed.

<h2>When to use</h2>
Ideal for a solo project. In your project, you can use this model in order to see what changes have occurred during the development process. After the work done, you can return to any of the previous versions. It is also great for small teams that have moved from syn to git.
